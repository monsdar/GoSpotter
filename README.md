# GoSpotter

**GoSpotter** is a family-friendly mobile game you can play cooperatively with family and friends while on the go - offline, easy and fun.

Going on a long trip through the countryside and want your kids to look onto something other than the tablet screen? Hanging our with your friends and looking for a fun activity? GoSpotter motivates everyone to look around, notice details, and spot the most interesting findings.

## How it works

1. **Start a new Run:** Whether you're on a holiday trip, visit the Zoo or simply sit at a café on the street corner - there's always something to discover. Just start a new run, pick a few Spot Packs, and you’re ready to play.  
   *Car Models? Check! Scandinavian Animals? Check! People Watching? Check!*
1. **Spot targets:** GoSpotter presents you with items to find together. Some are common, some rare — and the rarer they are, the more points they’re worth. Do you take the *Cow* for 1 point, hold out for a *Chicken* worth 3, or gamble on spotting a *Sheep* for 7? After each find, new targets appear.
1. **Finish the Run:** When you're done, close the run to see a summary of your adventure: total points, number of items found, and your rarest discoveries. Each run becomes a report card you can save or share with friends.
